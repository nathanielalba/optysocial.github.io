<h2>What Information About Me Is Collected and Stored?</h2>

Personal information is any information that can individually identify you and includes, among other things, your name, e-mail address, telephone number, postal address, credit card, billing and contact information. Non-personal information includes information that does not personally identify you, but it may include tracking and usage information about your location, demographics, use of the App and the Internet.</p>
<p><strong><u>Personal Information</u></strong></p>
<p>As a general matter, you can browse or use the App without submitting your personal information to us. However, there are a number of circumstances in which you may supply us or our agents with your personal information.

</ul>
<p><strong><u>Non-Personal Information</u></strong></p>
<p>In addition, when you interact with the App, we may collect certain information that does not identify you individually and our servers may automatically keep an activity log of your use of our App (“Non-Personal Information”). Generally, we collect and store the following categories of Non-Personal Information:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong><u>Collection of Your Source IP Address/Location Information</u></strong></p>

<p>When you interact with any Service Provider page or account on a social media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, LinkedIn, YouTube, or Pinterest, we may collect the personal information that you make available to us on that page or account including your account ID or “handle.” However, we will comply with the privacy policies of the corresponding social media platform and we will only collect and store such personal information that we are permitted to collect by these social media platforms. If you publish your social media profile on our Service, we may collect personal information that you make available as part of that profile.</p>

If you choose to use our referral service to tell someone about our App and Service or a discount on the App and Service, we will ask you for your contact’s name and email address. We will automatically send your contact a one-time email inviting him or her to visit our App. We store this information for the purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your contact may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@optysocial.io">privacy@optysocial.io</a><a href="http://www.shermanstravel.com/contact/?d=7"> </a>to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<p><strong><u>Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</u></strong></p>
<p>Like many websites and mobile applications, we use “cookies”, which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and actions. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the App and make it easier and/or relevant for your use. Like many App, we use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to record your preferences, track the use of our App and your exposure to our advertisements.

<p>We use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. We do not use flash cookies, web storage, web beacons or other technology that tracks your browsing history across multiple locations.</p>
<p>We use cookies for the other purposes set out below: </p>
<ul>
 <li>We use      cookies to remind us who you are and to find your account information in      our database when you access a service so you do not need to log in at      every visit. This helps us to provide you with service tailored to your      specific needs and interests. A cookie is created when you register for a      service </li>
 <li>We use      cookies to determine the browser the visitor uses so the site can be      designed to work properly with the most common versions of different      browsers </li>
 <li>We use      cookies in conjunction with sending you e-mail newsletters</li>
 <li>Advertisers      that place ads on the App may use cookies </li>

 <li>We use      cookies to estimate our audience size. Your browser is given a unique      cookie that helps us determine whether yours is a repeat visit or a first      visit </li>
</ul>
<p>We also use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), on our App. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the App, compile reports on the App activity, and provide other services related to s activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring site.

<p>We may partner with third party advertising companies to better provide advertisements about our goods and services that may be of interest to you. These third party advertisers may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the App. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different App and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content. These online advertising partners do not have access to or use your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personally identifiable information from us, without your consent. They may, however, use persistent identifiers to anonymously track your Internet usage across other sites in their networks beyond this App. While we restrict their further use of such information, such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you, unknown to us. </p>
<p>Third-party ad serving companies and other unaffiliated advertisers also display advertisements on our site. As part of their service, they may place a separate cookie on your computer or utilize other data collection and tracking technologies, to collect information such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server, and whether you responded to a particular advertisement. For a listing of the third party companies we may allow to place cookies to serve ads on the App, click _____. We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies, how they may be used, or the information they may collect and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of those third parties.  Please visit the sites of those businesses at the links above to review their privacy policies. We may add or change the list of third party ad servers from time to time and we encourage you to check this section for changes. You can learn more about about online advertising at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/consumers</a>. </p>
<p>Many of the third party advertisers that place tracking tools on our App are members of programs that offer you additional choices regarding the collection and use of your information. You can learn more about the options available to limit these third parties’ collection and use of your information by visiting the App for the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> and the <a href="http://www.youradchoices.com/aboutus.aspx">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>, as well as the webpages for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/ads/">Facebook’s ad preferences tool</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php">privacy policy</a>. </p>
<p>Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings. For more information about how to change these settings for Apple or Android devices, see:</p>

<p>Android: <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/">http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/</a> </p>
<p>Please note that opting-out of advertising networks services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our App or on other sites, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs. It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.</p>
<p>Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. Because a “Do Not Track” compliance protocol has not yet been finalized, Company’s information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that we provide to customers, will continue to operate as described in this privacy policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.</p>
